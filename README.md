# Project-Risk-Analytics-Tool
This project demonstrates the transition of 10+ years of industrial project management experience into data-driven decision-making tools using SQL and Python.

This tool calculates project risk scores using the PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) formula:

ExpectedDuration= (Optimistic+(4×Planned)+Pessimistic) / 6
​	
It further adjusts this score based on stakeholder complexity and external risk factors to prioritize management focus.
